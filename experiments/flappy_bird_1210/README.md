## 🧠 Observations
• gpt-5.1-extended-thinking: Followed the prompt cleanly with a solid UI. The bird includes a proper beak, and both a live score counter and high score counter are implemented. Overall, a very polished and functional result.

• gemini-3-pro: UI effort was noticeably lower. The bird lacks a beak, and there is no high score counter, but the core gameplay works as expected. Despite missing visual details, the execution is still solid.

• grok-4.1-thinking: Limited UI polish, but the bird correctly includes a beak. The game functions properly, though it lacks a high score metric. Functional but visually minimal.

• opus-4.5-thinking-32k: Exceptional attention to UI and bird detail. The bird includes internal animated sections that move with gravity, delivering the most visually impressive result. Best overall UI with a proper high score system implemented.
