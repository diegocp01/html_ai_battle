# 🧪 HTML AI Battle, HTML Animation Experiment

**TLDR:**  
4 Models try to: Generate a single file interactive falling sand simulation with gravity, sand, water, and stone using cellular automata physics.

---

## 🎯 Original Prompt

Create a single-file HTML/CSS/JS "Falling Sand" simulation. It must be interactive, the user should be able to click and drop the physical element, basic purpose here is gravity, elements and mass. Implement cellular automata physics where Sand (yellow) falls and piles up, Water (blue) falls and flows horizontally, and Stone (grey) behaves as rigid blocks that fall under gravity but, once they land, stay completely static without changing size, shape, or merging. Include a generic "Void" background, allow mouse dragging to paint particles, and add buttons to switch between materials.
