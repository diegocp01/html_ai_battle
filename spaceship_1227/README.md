## 🤖 Per-Model Output Summary


---

## Weighted Performance Score
A single score that combines how well the model follows the prompt, how correctly the code works, and how good the UI looks.  
**performance_score = 0.40(prompt_adherence_score) + 0.35(functional_correctness_score) + 0.25(ui_score)**


---

## ✅ Experiment Rules
	•	✅ Same exact prompt for all models
	•	✅ First output only (no retries, no iterations)
	•	✅ Raw HTML outputs preserved exactly
	•	✅ No human edits
